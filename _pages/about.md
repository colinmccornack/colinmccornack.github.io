Hello! My name is Colin McCornack. I am currently in the PhD phase of my MD/PhD at [Washington University School of Medicine](https://mstp.wustl.edu/), where I am in the Computational and Systems Biology program under the mentorship of [Dr. Ting Wang](wang.wustl.edu). I made this page mainly to serve as an advice repository regarding the MSTP admissions process, based on my own experiences and those of my peers. Hopefully I'll also have some links and posts regarding my thesis work, and later on maybe even my experiences with the remaining clinical phase and residency application process when that is all said and done.
